# ld-decode-orc

**ld-decode-orc** is a cross-platform orchestration and processing framework for LaserDisc decoding workflows.

It aims to brings structure and consistency to complex LaserDisc decoding processes, making them easier to run, repeat, and understand.

`ld-decode-orc` is a direct replacment for the existing ld-deocde-tools, coordinating each step of the process and keeping track of inputs, outputs, and results.

The project aims to:
- Make advanced LaserDisc workflows (from TBC to chroma) easier to manage
- Reduce manual steps and error-prone command sequences
- Help users reproduce the same results over time

A graphical interface is also planned, alongside support for automated and scripted workflows.

This project is under active development.
