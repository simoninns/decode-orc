 * @brief Raw material for one stage's parameter dialogue.
 *
 * The stage's own descriptors and the node's stored values say what the form
 * holds; the rest describes the graph around the node, which is what decides
 * how some of those parameters should be presented — which channel pairs are
 * actually selectable, what "reset" should mean, what the header has to say.
 * Every field beyond the first four is optional: a stage that does not consult
 * the graph leaves them empty and passes through untouched.
 *
 * Gathering these needs a presenter; deriving the dialogue's contents from
 * them does not, which is the reason for the split. The parameter dialogue is
 * modeless, so this derivation is repeated whenever the graph changes under an
 * open window and cannot live inline in the code that opens one.
