# Audio Channel Map

Routes the left/right channels of audio channel pairs following SMPTE 272M. Use it to remove a channel pair, extract a channel as mono in place, or copy a channel as mono into another channel pair. One operation per stage instance; chain instances for compound routing.

## When to use

LaserDisc bilingual discs and tapes with independent linear/Hi-Fi programmes carry two unrelated mono programmes as the left and right channels of a single stereo pair. To split such a dual-mono pair into two independent, named mono pairs:

1. `copy_right_to_target` with target `new`, **Add description** ticked and description `French language` — appends a pair holding the right programme as mono.
2. `left_to_mono` on the original pair, **Add description** ticked and description `English language` — keeps the left programme in place.

(Or `delete` the original pair instead of step 2 if you routed both channels to new pairs first.)

The in-place `left_to_mono` / `right_to_mono` operations fix a one-sided recording without changing the pair count.

Per SMPTE 272M-1994 §6.4, a mono programme must occupy one channel of the pair while the other channel is silent (all zeros). Every mono operation here follows that rule — the chosen channel is placed on the left and the right channel is zeroed; a channel is never duplicated across both.

The operation is a pure per-sample channel remap on the synchronous 48 kHz 24-bit pipeline audio; timing and per-frame sample counts are untouched.

## What it does

The stage wraps the incoming frame representation and remaps channels on the fly. Video, dropout hints, EFM/AC3 signal data, and all untouched channel pairs pass through unchanged.

- `delete` removes the selected channel pair. The pair count drops by one and every later channel pair shifts down one index.
- `left_to_mono` / `right_to_mono` overwrite the selected pair in place with the chosen channel on the left and the right channel silenced (`[L, 0]` or `[R, 0]`). The pair is marked origin `DERIVED`.
- `copy_left_to_target` / `copy_right_to_target` read the selected (source) pair and write the chosen channel as mono to the **target** pair, leaving the source untouched. With target `new` the mono pair is appended (subject to the 8-pair limit); with an existing target that pair is overwritten. The written pair is marked `DERIVED`.

By default the resulting pair keeps its existing description. Tick **Add description** to give it a new one (see `set_description` / `description` below).

The stage fails validation when the selected channel pair does not exist on the input, when a chosen target pair does not exist, or when appending would exceed the 8-pair limit.

## Parameters

### channel_pair
The channel pair the operation reads from — the source for the copy operations, or the pair modified/deleted for the others. Channel-pair numbers are 0-based, matching the CVBS container `_audio_<n>.wav` numbering. In the GUI this is a dropdown restricted to the channel pairs the node's input actually carries (index plus description).

### operation
String, default `left_to_mono`. One of:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `delete` | Remove the channel pair; later pairs shift down one index |
| `left_to_mono` | Keep the left channel, silence the right (`[L, 0]`), in place |
| `right_to_mono` | Move the right channel to the left, silence the right (`[R, 0]`), in place |
| `copy_left_to_target` | Copy the left channel as mono to the target pair; source untouched |
| `copy_right_to_target` | Copy the right channel as mono to the target pair; source untouched |

### target_pair
Destination for the copy operations (shown only when the operation is `copy_left_to_target` or `copy_right_to_target`). `new` appends a new channel pair; otherwise the mono channel overwrites the chosen existing pair. In the GUI this is a dropdown offering `new` plus the channel pairs the input carries.

### set_description
Boolean, default off. **Add description** — shown for every operation except `delete`. When off, the pair the operation produces keeps its existing description. Tick it to reveal the `description` field and give the pair a new name.

### description
Name for the channel pair the operation produces — the target pair for the copy operations, or the source pair for the in-place mono operations (e.g. `English language`). Shown only when **Add description** is ticked.

## Tools

This stage has no interactive tools.

## Status Indicator

The coloured dot in the top-right corner of the node shows its configuration status.

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | Fully configured and ready to run. All required parameters are set. |
| Yellow | Partially configured. The stage can run but will use default or reduced behaviour — for example, pass-through mode or console-only output. Review the parameters for optional settings. |
| Red | Not configured. One or more required parameters are missing and the stage cannot run. |

Parameters can be set via **Edit Parameters...** in the node context menu. Some stages also provide interactive stage tools (listed under **Tools** above) that set parameters directly from within the tool.
